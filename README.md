This project proposes a robust neural network-based method that directly solves the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) derived from kinetic models. By discretizing the derivative
term using finite difference methods, ODEs are parameterized as a four-layer neural network. The network is optimized by minimizing a specialized loss function that incorporates
physiological constraints. The delay correction and parallel network processing are also incorporated for voxellevel parametric PET imaging.
